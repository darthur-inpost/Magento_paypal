Magento_paypal
==============

A widget to allow the creation of parcels for Magento and a fix for the express method

Directory Structure
===================
There is a directory called 'paypal' which contains the file reveiw.phtml.

This file needs to be installed into the template that is being used by the store. You must either replace the existing file in the default directory structure or ammend the current template version.

The file, review.phtml, has been annotated to show the changes that have been made and that should be made to your local file.

It should exist in a directory structure similar to the following:-

	app/design/frontend/default/*Your Template*/template/paypal/express/review.phtml
